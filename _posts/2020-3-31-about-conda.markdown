## conda

Today I try to install and use pytorch with CUDA on my Windows 10 machine.

It's totally a joke, may be.

Both Win's dim and fuzzy font (may be caused by HDMI?) annoys me a lot.

F**k, my horrible written English.

## school life

My X86 server and monitor are trapped in my dorm room.

F**k those administration staff,
they even haven't filled in a single form after spending a whole day,
which is applying for entering the dormitory.
