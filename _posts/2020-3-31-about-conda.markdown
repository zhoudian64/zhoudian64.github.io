## conda

Today I try to install and use pytorch with CUDA on my Windows 10 machine.

It's totally a joke, may be.

Both Win's dim and fuzzy font (may be caused by HDMI?) annoys me a lot.

After I spend about 4 hours on QuEST (Quantum computing simulationg frame work) on GPU,
~~emmm~~ it seems all errors actually comes from Nvidia's arrogant.
It not only didn't want to do some actual open source work,
but also didn't willing to provide LTS compatible software to individual buyers.

F**k, my horrible written English.


## school life

My X86 server and monitor are trapped in my dorm room.

F**k those administration staff,
they even haven't filled in a single form after spending a whole day,
which is applying for entering the dormitory.
