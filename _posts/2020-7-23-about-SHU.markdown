It's a horrible world...

Commonly, Students need about 8 months or more to prepare for their
master degree entrance exam. Or They may need 3 months or even longer
to have their internship in various companies.

But in this HORRIBLE college. You have got a lot of just Java or .Net
Web to write to build those silly Websites. And if you want to enjoy
you time have a salary or hone your sword yourself in some company,
you need to both attend all classes, which is all not related with
projects.

What i tried to express is, just run. PLZ don't come CES department,
you've got neither chance to get your master degree tickets, or a
good job here. I've heard a lot of guys in new media Department got
employed by Alibaba or ByteDance.

Here you won't learn anything in following list:
- English Express
```text
As you can see in this article, my English skill is ridiculous.
I don't know how to improve it. Maybe you should try to get into some
foreign companies. And communicate with your mentor.
```
- Code during interview
```text
Only if you join ACM team, you may get this skill. It's very
important. Since Interviewer will give you one round after another.
If you hate SJ, maybe your can teach yourself @ https://leetcode.com
English site maybe better( 
```
- Do Robust Code
Sincerely, 99.99%+ your code in your development experience
in the first three years should be called script. No matter what
language you are using. They turn to become a "Process" only once.
You hardly can find out all kinds or bugs(or failure of design).

- ...
emmm I will fill here some day after those silly CRUD projects.
